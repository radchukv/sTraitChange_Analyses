# sTraitChange_Analyses

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of sTraitChange_Analyses project is to provide the full workflow as well as the data needed to reproduce the analyses for the manuscript 'Changes in phenology mediate vertebrate population responses to climate globally' by Radchuk et al. (submitted). The analyses in this repository rely heavily on the functions available from [sTraitChange](https://github.com/radchukv/sTraitChange) package. 

To be able to run these analyses you will have to install [sTraitChange](https://github.com/radchukv/sTraitChange) package. 

## Structure

This project contains the following folders:  
- data: datasets used in the analyses;   
- output_SEM_all: general outputs from the analyses based on structural equation models (SEMs);   
- output_forSEM_precip and output_forSEM_temp: the prepared datasets ready for running SEMs using, respectively precipitation and temperature as climate variables;      
- output_fSEM_precip and output_fSEM_temp: the output from the SEM analyses, that are used later on in meta-analyses, obtained, using respectively precipitation and temperature as climate variables;     
- output_fSEM_noDD_precip and output_fSEM_noDD_temp: the output from the SEM analyses conducted without population size included in SEM (sensitivity analyses: for details, see the manuscript). Some of these generated results are intermediate and are later used in meta-analyses. These results are obtained, using respectively precipitation and temperature as climate variable;    
- output_all_noDD: general output from the analyses conducted when population size is not included in the SEM;   
- output_all: general output obtained from the complete workflow;    
- plots_ms: plots used in the manuscript;   
- tables: tables produced during the analyses;   
- scripts: all R scripts used in the workflow (more details below).    

## Scripts

The scripts are numbered in the logical order in which they are used in the analyses. The scripts  pertaining to sliding window analyses will not run out of the box because relevant climate datasets could not be shared in the repo (due to its prohibitively big size). In order to run those scripts
the user will have to download the climate data from the respective sources mentioned in Supplementary materials (Table S6) and place them in the respective directory on the path (./data).  

Brief description of what each script does:   
- **1.1_DataPrep_Clim.R**: prepares climate data for sliding window analyses using `climwin` package.  
- **1.2_DataPrep_Biol.R**: prepares biological data for sliding window analyses using `climwin` package.    
- **2_climwin.R**: performs sliding window analyses (will not run directly, see above!);    
- **3.0_PrepData_forSEM.R**: prepares the data for SEM analyses;   
- **3.1_SEM.R**: performs SEM analyses;    
- **4.0_Descriptive.R**: provides description of the total dataset;   
- **4.1_ClimwinWindows.R**: describes results from sliding window analyses;   
- **4.2_NonLinAssumption.R**: assess non-linearity assumptions;   
- **5.1_Phylo_prep.R**: prepares a mega-tree for performing meta-analyses that account for phylogenetic relatedness;   
- **5.2.1_Metaanalysis_Temp.R**: meta-analyses focusing on temperature as climate variable;   
- **5.2.2_Metaanalysis_Precip.R**: meta-analyses focusing on precipitation as climate variable;   
- **5.3.1_Metaanalysis_Temp_noDD.R** & **5.3.2_Metaanalysis_Precip_noDD.R**: meta-analyses focusing, respectively on temperature and precipitation as climate variable and performed without the population size in SEM (sensitivity analyses);    
- **5.4_Metaanalysis_AcrossPhylogenies.R**: a script running meta-analyses across 100 posterior phylogenies;    
- **5.5_Metaanalysis_HeterogeneityPaths.R**: a script explaining the heterogeneity in the SEM paths with hypothesized predictors;   
- **5.6_Metaanalysis_Heterogeneity_FineCatNames.R**: assessing the impact of the exact measured trait on heterogeneity in the phenotypic responses to climate;    
- **6_pDeltaAIC.R**: exploration of the potential impact that pDeltaAIC has on the results;   
- **7_Figures_MS.R**: Figures used in the manuscript.
